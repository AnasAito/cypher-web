# ``CypherWeb``

## A Cypher layer to query the web

[**Live demo**](https://cypher-web.streamlit.app/)

</section>

### Important Note: 
This repository is currently a work in progress while you can use it for some basic yet good enough queries, I'm still sketching a propper dev roadmap for it that I can share with interested members of the community.

The reason for this premature release is that I wanted to share the main idea behind it with the community and any development coming will only enhance it and make this tool usable in production environments

### The key problem:
The key problem that Cypherweb is trying to solve is very simple: we take for granted HTML data, in other words, we treat it as unstructured text and dont make use of its semistructured format.

## Install

Run the following command to get the latest version ``cypherweb``
```bash
pip install cypherweb==0.0.2
```
## Example of usage

If you are familiar with Cypher language, using CypherWeb will be easy.

Letâ€™s say you are interested in extracting some team members' data from a set of websites. Instead of building custom templates specific to each website, cypherweb will ease this. we know that usually team members are presented as grids, which could be a set of "li" elements or custom HTML elements that share the same style or inner structure. 

Let's test the extraction using an example


```python
# test new restruction
from cypherweb.core import GraphProcessPipeline, NodeSearchPipeline, Graph

from cypherweb.nodes.html_to_graph import HtmlToGraph
from cypherweb.nodes.connectors import BasicCrawler
from cypherweb.nodes.classifiers import GridClassifier
from cypherweb.nodes.classifiers import LinkListClassifier
from cypherweb.nodes.classifiers import TitleClassifier
from cypherweb.nodes.classifiers import LinkClassifier
from cypherweb.nodes.str_matchers import BaseStrRetriever
from cypherweb.nodes.search import GraphNearestNeighbor
from cypherweb.nodes.cypher import CypherApi
from rich import print as rprint

# step 1 : create graph

graph_pipe = GraphProcessPipeline()

graph_pipe.add_node(
    BasicCrawler(),
    "crawler",
)
graph_pipe.add_node(
    HtmlToGraph(),
    "html_to_graph",
)
graph_pipe.add_node(
    GridClassifier(),
    "grid_classifier",
)
graph_pipe.add_node(
    LinkListClassifier(),
    "link_list_classifier",
)
graph_pipe.add_node(
    TitleClassifier(),
    "title_classifier",
)
graph_pipe.add_node(
    LinkClassifier(),
    "link_classifier",
)

# # step 2 :  use graph for retrieval
search_pipe = NodeSearchPipeline()
search_pipe.add_node(
    CypherApi(),
    "cypher_api",
)
search_pipe.add_node(graph_pipe, "graph_process_pipe")
search_pipe.add_node(
    BaseStrRetriever(),
    "str_matcher",
)
search_pipe.add_node(
    GraphNearestNeighbor(),
    "graph_nn",
)


# use your pipeline!
search_pipe.run(
"""
USE "https://weaviate.io/company/about-us"
MATCH (a:Grid)-[e*1..2]->(t:Title)
WHERE t.text contains "team"
RETURN a, t
"""
)
rprint(search_pipe.passing_input)

```
